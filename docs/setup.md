## Setting Up a New Warehouse Environment

## Creating a New Client Environment

Each client implementation of the RA Warehouse Framework requires you to either clone, or ideally fork, the master repo to create a client-specific environment you can then customise and extend.

Cloning the repo creates a copy based on the current state of the master repo, and that copy is then completely separate and disconnected from the master; meaning that:

- No changes we introduce to the master can potentially break the client-specific copy, or vice-versa, but
- No additions, fixes or enhancements we add to the master can automatically be slipstreamed into the client-specific repo (again, or vice-versa)

### 1. Cloning the master repo

Using Github Desktop or the git CLI on Terminal, clone the git repo:

```
git clone git@github.com:rittmananalytics/ra_data_warehouse.git
```
or use the "Use this Template" Github feature we've enabled for this repo, as per the screenshot below.

### 2. Forking the master repo

Ideally though you should [fork the repo instead of cloning it](https://github.community/t/the-difference-between-forking-and-cloning-a-repository/10189); by doing this you preserve the link between the client-specific repo and the master repo making it possible to pull updates and bug fixes from the master repo, and push reusable code back up to the master repo in the form of a pull request (PR).

These additional abilities enabled by forking are key to the value of the framework, in that they:

 - Allow us to fix issues in the core code we use for all client projects, fix the issue in one place (the master repo) and push those fixes out to all of our client projects in an efficient manner, and
 - Provide a way for our learnings on one client engagement to be efficiently shared with our colleagues, and other clients, rather than being buried in one specific implementation never to be seen again

However clients will normally want their Github repos to be private, and you can't normally fork a repo and make it private using that git service, so to do so you'll need to follow these steps:

#### Create a private copy of the ra-data-warehouse repository

1.  Create a bare clone of the ra-data-warehouse repository
```
git clone --bare https://github.com/rittmananalytics/ra_data_warehouse.git
```
2.  Create a new private repository in client account
3.  Mirror-push your bare clone to the new client repository
```
cd ra_data_warehouse.git
git push --mirror https://github.com/clientaccount/repository.git
```
4.  Remove the temporary ra-data-warehouse local repository
```
rm -rf ra_data_warehouse.git
```
#### Add upstream remotes

1.  Clone the client’s repository
2.  Add the ra-data-warehouse repository as the a remote to fetch future changes
```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/rittmananalytics/ra_data_warehouse.git
```
3.  List remotes
```
git remote -v
```
#### STILL NEEDS TO BE EXPERIMENTED WITH - To update client’s repository with upstream changes

1.  Fetch and merge changes
```
git pull upstream master
```
## Configuring Standard Data Sources

2. Create or edit `profiles.yml` with the following content and place it under `~/.dbt/` on your machine. For safety, `dev` is a default target.

```yaml
ra_data_warehouse:
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: bigquery
      method: service-account-json
      project: [your GCP project id]
      dataset: analytics_dev
      location: [your GCP data location]
      threads: 1
      timeout_seconds: 300
      keyfile_json:
        type: service_account
        project_id: [your GCP project id]
        private_key_id: [your private key id]
        private_key: [your private key, with quotes (") aroumd key]
        client_email: [your client_email]
        client_id: [your client ID]
        auth_uri: https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth
        token_uri: https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token
        auth_provider_x509_cert_url: https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs
        client_x509_cert_url: [your GCP pclient_x509_cert_url]
    prd:
      type: bigquery
      method: service-account-json
      project: [your GCP project id]
      dataset: analytics
      location: [your GCP data location]
      threads: 1
      timeout_seconds: 300
      keyfile_json:
        type: service_account
        project_id: [your GCP project id]
        private_key_id: [your private key id]
        private_key: [your private key, with quotes (") aroumd key]
        client_email: [your client_email]
        client_id: [your client ID]
        auth_uri: https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth
        token_uri: https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token
        auth_provider_x509_cert_url: https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs
        client_x509_cert_url: [your GCP pclient_x509_cert_url]
```

4. Enable or Disable Data Sources and Warehouse Modules

Using a text editor, edit the `dbt_project.yml` config file to enable/disable individual data sources or warehouse modules

```yaml
vars:
      enable_harvest_projects_source:      [true|false]
      enable_hubspot_crm_source:           [true|false]
      enable_asana_projects_source:        [true|false]
      enable_jira_projects_source:         [true|false]
      enable_stripe_payments_source:       [true|false]
      enable_xero_accounting_source:       [true|false]
      enable_mailchimp_email_source:       [true|false]
      enable_segment_events_source:        [true|false]
      enable_google_ads_source:            [true|false]
      enable_facebook_ads_source:          [true|false]
      enable_intercom_messaging_source:    [true|false]
      enable_custom_source_1:              [true|false]
      enable_custom_source_2:              [true|false]
      enable_mixpanel_events_source:       [true|false]
# warehouse modules
      enable_crm_warehouse:         [true|false]e
      enable_finance_warehouse:     [true|false]
      enable_projects_warehouse:    [true|false]
      enable_marketing_warehouse:   [true|false]
      enable_ads_warehouse:         [true|false]
      enable_product_warehouse:     [true|false]
```

If you have enriched either your contacts or companies records with enrichment data e.g. from Clearbit, this feature can be enabled in this part of the config file too;

```yaml
      enable_clearbit_enrichment_source:   [true|false]
      contacts_enrichment:                 [true|false]
      companies_enrichment:                [true|false]
```

5. Then, within the same `dbt_project.yml` config file and for each data source enabled, provide the schema and table name for each table within the data source for each ETL pipeline technology, and the choice of which pipeline you want to use.

For example, for Facebook Ads where only Stitch is supported as the ETL pipeline

```yaml
stg_facebook_ads:
              vars:
                  id-prefix: fbads-
                  etl: stitch
                  stitch_schema: stitch_facebook_ads
                  stitch_adcreative_table: adcreative
                  stitch_ads_table: ads
                  stitch_adsets_table: adsets
                  stitch_campaigns_table: campaigns
                  stitch_ads_insights_age_and_gender_table: ads_insights_age_and_gender
                  stitch_ads_insights_table: ads_insights
                  tags: ["facebook", "ads", "marketing"]
```

For Mixpanel where both Stitch and Fivetran are supported as ETL pipelines, provide a value for the `etl` variable to indicate whether Stitch or Fivetran is the pipeline technology for this data source (note that you can use Stitch for some data sources and Fivetran for others, and you can create copies of data source adapters if you have one source using one and one using the other as long as the id-prefix value is unique for each data source)

```yaml
stg_mixpanel_events:
              vars:
                  id-prefix: mixpanel-
                  stitch_schema: mixpanel_stitch
                  fivetran_schema: fivetran_mixpanel
                  etl: fivetran
                  fivetran_event_table: event
                  stitch_export_table: export
                  tags: ["mixpanel", "events","marketing"]

```

Note also that some data sources have variables specific to just those data sources, for example `staff_email_domain:` for the stg_asana_projects data source; also note the variables set with default values in the `integration:` section.

### Configuring BigQuery Table and Dataset Settings

6. You can also configure the dataset prefixes used for the sources, integration, utilities and warehouse database objects as well as whether they are created as SQL views, tables or ephemeral (sub-queries) in the `dbt_project.yml`, or leave them at their default values.

```yaml
models:
  ra_data_warehouse:
# data source general settings
      sources:
          materialized: [view|ephemeral|table, default is `view`]
          schema: [schema prefix for source models, default is `staging`]
# integration layer settings
      integration:
          materialized: [view|ephemeral|table, default is view]
          schema: staging [schema prefix for integration models, default is `staging`]
          vars:
              web_sessionization_trailing_window: 3
              web_inactivity_cutoff: 30 * 60
# warehouse layer settings
      warehouse:
          materialized: [view|ephemeral|table, default is table]
# util module settings
      utils:
          materialized: [view|ephemeral|table, default is view]
          schema: [schema prefix for utils models, default is `logs`]
# seed module settings
seeds:
  ra_data_warehouse:
    schema: [schema prefix for utils models, default is `seeds`]
```

### Other Setup Steps

7. Configure and connect your Stitch, Fivetran, Segment and other data sources in-line with the configuration settings you have provided in steps 4,5 and 6 so that raw data from each of your SaaS data sources is now available within your data warehouse, ready for transformation.

8. [Other information on setting up machine](https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/how-we-set-up-our-computers-for-working-on-dbt-projects/243)

### CLI Steps

9. In the command line, with current directory set to be in the root of the project (`~/dbt`), optionally set a schema prefix to be used in-front of each of the dataset names dbt will be creating for you, for example to create multiple RA Warehouse environments within the same GCP project.

```
export schema_prefix=mark
```

Then run [dbt deps](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deps) to collect latest versions of dependencies, open-source dbt packages etc.

```
dbt deps
```

Then import your seed data files:
```
dbt seed --profile ra_data_warehouse --target dev
```

10. Finally, start your first data warehouse load.
```
dbt run --profile ra_data_warehouse --target dev
```
